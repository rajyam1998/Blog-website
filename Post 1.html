            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two of the most talked-about technologies today. But what exactly are they, and how do they impact our daily lives?</p>
            <p>AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. ML, a subset of AI, involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to improve their performance on a task through experience.</p>
            <p>Applications of AI and ML are vast, ranging from voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced data analytics in healthcare, finance, and other industries.</p>
            <p>In the future, we can expect AI and ML to drive even more innovation, making technology more intuitive and efficient.</p>
